            Promises are an important part of the JS ecosystem. It's important
            to know how the event loop works with the execution order of async
            functions. Also why performance matters and how using Promises
            incorrectly can cause a bottleneck in your application

              Let's look at a basic example of how asynchronous code is
              executed. Can anyone guess in what order the numbers would be
              printed in?

              This is how it works under the hood. The JS engine consists of two
              parts. The call stack and the Web or Node API's if on the backend.
              The asynchronous API's like setTimeout and promises are moved to
              the Web API and passed to the event loop that consists of two
              queues, micro and macrotasks.<br />

              All async operations are loaded in the queue, prioritised, and
              passed back to the call stack for processing. We will look at how
              they are prioritised in the later slides.

              Any idea why <code>setImmediate</code> is always invoked before
              <code>setTimeout</code>?<br />

              <code>setImmediate</code> checks queue of I/O eventhandlers. If
              all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes
              the callback<br />

              <code>setTimeout</code> is executed after all the executing and
              currently queued eventhandlers finish first. So immediate will
              alwsys be executed before timeout regardless of where it resides
              in code
            </aside>

            Why is immediate always invoked before timeout?

              What about <code>process.nextTick</code> and Promises?<br />

              Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.
              <code>nextTick()</code> makes sure that in the next event loop
              iteration that code is already executed. i.e. after all
              synchronous code is executed and all handlers are queued<br />

              So does this mean <code>nextTick()</code> always executes before
              Promises? It's never simple when JS is involved!

              Anyone here who doesn't know what CJS and ESM are?<br />
              ESM supports something known as top-level await, where we can
              write <code>await</code> at the top without using the
              <code>async keyword</code>. So, when we run any script as ESM, the
              script is already in the microtask phase because we are already in
              an async context

              This is an example from one of my previous projects that I worked
              on. We were parsing a huge JSON file to get a list of registered
              users and this is a short snippet of that code<br />

              This created a promise chain for every record in the JSON and
              hogged up a huge amount of memory. This was inefficient and
              wasteful in terms of memory usage and performance<br />
              There's also a better way if you need to perform async operations
              on large amounts of data and that is using a library called
              <code>p-map</code> where you can control how many concurrent
              executions run at once

              What happens if we profile this function with traces to check the
              performance? For the sake of time, I have already run this
              <code>processJSON</code> file and created a tracing log generated
              by the command here in <code>package.json</code>. This command
              gives us the performance and async characteristics of our program
              that we can check using Chrome<br />

              If we load this file, here's what we get. Every single one of
              these lines is a promse and they are being created in a
              synchronous loop. And how do we know if it's synchronous and we
              see the v8 execute block which shows that it's synchronous<br />

              There is a timer here that is scheduling asynchronous activity but
              we're still allocating all those promises at once and the
              synchronous code running in those causes a massive event loop
              block. The event loop cannot do anything else at that time

              <li>Do not make synchronous code asynchronous</li>
              <li>
                If you really need to create promises in loops, batch process

              </li>
              <li>
                As we saw in the <code>processJSON</code> function, promises are
                high priority in the event loop microtask queue and that will
                prevent other code from executing as these nested promises will
                always be taken in first
              </li>
              <li>
                And last but not the least, keep it simple! Synchronous
                JavaScript is fast enough so we don't need to convert it into
